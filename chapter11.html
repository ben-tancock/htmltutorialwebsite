		<p>You can specify colour in CSS in one of the three ways:</p>
		<ul id="justify">
			<li>RBG Values:
				<p>These express colours in terms of how much red, green, and blue are used to make it up.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Hex Codes:
				<p>These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a colour. Preceeded by the hash symbol.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Color Names:
				<p>There are 147 predefined colour names that are recognized by browsers.</p>
			</li>

		<h2>Contrast:</h2>
		<p>When picking foreground and background colours, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be eligible.</p>
	</div>

	<br><br><br>

	<table align="center">

		<tr>
			<th>
				<div id="lowcont">
					<p>LOW CONTRAST</p>
				</div>
			</th>

			<th>
				<div id="medcont">
					<p>MEDIUM CONTRAST</p>
				</div>
			</th>

			<th>
				<div id="highcont">
					<p>HIGH CONTRAST</p>
				</div>
			</th>
		</tr>

		<tr valign="top">
			<td>
				<p>Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colours.</p>
				<p>A lack of contrast is particularly a problem for those with visual impairment or colour blindness.</p>
				<p>It also affects those with poor monitors and sunlight on their screens.</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between the background and foreground colours. If you want people to read a lot of text on your page, however, then too much contrast can be harder to read too.</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.</p>
				<p>You can reduce the contrast by using dark grey text on a white background or an off-white text on a dark background.</p>
			</td>

		<h2>CSS3: OPACITY</h2>

		<p>CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50%, etc.)</p>
	</div>

	<div id="whitebox">

			The red square below has an opacity of 0.5. <br> The blue square is not opaque at all.

		<h2>CSS3: HSL COLOURS</h2>

		<p>
			CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colours using hue, saturation, and lightness values. These properties are modified with the hsl and hsla (hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha) attributes. 
		</p>
	</div>
	<br><br>

	<table>
			<tr>
				<th>HUE</th>
				<th>SATURATION</th>
				<th>LIGHTNESS</th>
				<th>ALPHA</th>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td> 
					<p>Hue is the colloquial idea for colour.</p>
				</td>

				<td>
					<p>Saturation is the amount of grey in a coulour. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of grey.</p>
				</td>

				<td>
					<p>
						Lightness is the amount of white or black in a colour. Like saturation, lightness is also represented as a percentage, where 100% is white, and 50% is normal.
					</p>
				</td>

				<td>
					<p>
						Alpha represents transparency, and is expressed as a number from 0 and 1.0. 
					</p>
				</td>

		<p>The formatting of your text can have a significant effect on how readable your pages are. As we look through these properties I will also give you some design tips on how to display your type.</p>

		<p>@font-face allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a copy of the font, which will be downloaded if it is not on the user's machine. </p>

		<p>
			Because this technique allows a version of the font to be downloaded on a user's computer, it is important that the license for the font permits it to be used in this way. You add the font to your style sheet using the @font-face rule in a CSS sheet.
		</p>

		<p>When I was downloading the fonts I wanted from the fonts.google website, they have instructions on how to embed when you select the font.</p>

		<p>FYI, put your fonts in the CSS folder. Would have saved me a huge headache had the book mentioned this...</p>

		<p>See how much nicer this font looks?</p>

		<p>The way I changed this font, I downloaded the font, put it in the website resources folders, and linked it to the style sheet with the @font-face method. But since you need to do a lot more work to get that font to work with every other browser (different browsers support different file types), I'm going to do the easy way instead: linking the font through a google url.</p>

		<p>The book goes over a lot of stuff you can do with text, but I'm gonna gloss over the stuff that's already pretty obvious (e.g. bold, italics, etc.) and showcase the things which might actually be useful:</p>

		<p id="lead">Leading (pronounced ledding) is the term typographers use for the vertical space inbetween lines. This might be useful for lists and such. This is done with the line-height attribute.</p>

		<p id="kerning">Kerning is the term typographers use for the space between each letter. You can control this with the letter-spacing attribute.</p>

		<p id="justify">You can set text-alignment to 'justify', which indicates that every line in a paragrah, except the last line, should be set to take up the full width of the containing box.</p>

		<p id="indent">You can use the text-indent property to indent the first line of text within an element. The amount you want to be indented can be indicated in em's or px.</p>

		<p>You can use the :link and :visited (e.g. a:link { ... } etc.) in CSS files to set styles for links that have and have not been visited.</p>

		<h3>Responding to users:</h3>
		<ul id="justify">
			<li>:hover - This is applied when a user hovers over an element. Commonly used to change appearance of links, buttons, etc.</li><br>
			<li>:active - This is applied when an element is activated by a user; for example, when a button is being pressed or a link being clicked. Sometimes this is used to make a button feel like it is actually being clicked.</li><br>
			<li>:focus - This is applied when an element has focus. Any element you interact with, such as a link you can click on or any form control can have focus. Focus occurs when you browser discovers that you are ready to interact with an element on the page. For example, when your cursor is in a form and input ready to accept typing, that element is said to have focus. It is also possible to use the tab key on your keyboard to move through the interactive items on a page. When pseudo-classes are used, they should appear in this order: :link, :visited, :hover, :focus, :active.</li>
