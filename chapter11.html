		<p>You can specify colour in CSS in one of the three ways:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>RBG Values:
				<p>These express colours in terms of how much red, green, and blue are used to make it up.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Hex Codes:
				<p>These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a colour. Preceeded by the hash symbol.</p>
			</li>
			<li>Color Names:
				<p>There are 147 predefined colour names that are recognized by browsers.</p>

		<h2>Contrast:</h2>
		<p>When picking foreground and background colours, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be eligible.</p>

		<tr>
			<th>
				<div id="lowcont">
					<p>LOW CONTRAST</p>

				<p>Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colours.</p>
				<p>A lack of contrast is particularly a problem for those with visual impairment or colour blindness.</p>
				<p>It also affects those with poor monitors and sunlight on their screens.</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between the background and foreground colours. If you want people to read a lot of text on your page, however, then too much contrast can be harder to read too.</p>
			</td>
			<td>
				<p>For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.</p>
				<p>You can reduce the contrast by using dark grey text on a white background or an off-white text on a dark background.</p>

		<h2>CSS3: OPACITY</h2>

		<p>CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50%, etc.)</p>
	</div>

			The red square below has an opacity of 0.5. <br> The blue square is not opaque at all.

		<h2>CSS3: HSL COLOURS</h2>

		<p>
			CSS3 introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colours using hue, saturation, and lightness values. These properties are modified with the hsl and hsla (hue, saturation, lightness, and alpha) attributes. 
		</p>
	</div>
	<br><br>

	<table>
			<tr>
				<th>HUE</th>
				<th>SATURATION</th>
				<th>LIGHTNESS</th>
				<th>ALPHA</th>
			</tr>

			<tr>
				<td> 
					<p>Hue is the colloquial idea for colour.</p>
				</td>

				<td>
					<p>Saturation is the amount of grey in a coulour. Saturation is represented as a percentage. 100% is full saturation and 0% is a shade of grey.</p>
				</td>

				<td>
					<p>
						Lightness is the amount of white or black in a colour. Like saturation, lightness is also represented as a percentage, where 100% is white, and 50% is normal.
					</p>
				</td>

				<td>
					<p>
						Alpha represents transparency, and is expressed as a number from 0 and 1.0. 
					</p>
				</td>
